MCP Server on AKS

Implement the following scenario
1.	MCP Server is running on AKS. It’s simple MCP server returning just a common knowledge text, based on the input topic. It uses wiki API
2.	AI Agent running in Agent Service and connecting via SSE (server-side events) protocol to the MCP server to bring the context

Details
Implement MCP server. It has a single tool, “answerQ” , which receives a textual question and return, the answer. The MCP server behind the scenes calls, wiki API, so AKS cluster must have outbound traffic access to the internet.
Implement MCP server as a container. 
The container must support Linux as OS.
Implement Kubernetes manifests for MCP server. DeploymentSet, Service=Loadbalancer since MCP must expose public IP.
MCP must support, MSFT Entra authentication and RBACs. The AKS cluster will be configured to give access to the user identity
Create small AKS cluster (1 nodepool)
Deploy MCP server on it via DeploymentSet.
Check the access to MCP server via SSE (health check) from the local machine 
Create a MCP manifest (json) to connect to it from the VS Code, so I can ask trivia questions in VS Code GitHub copilot
Create an AI Agent in Foundry Agent Service, which uses the MCP server as a “tool”: tools=mcp_tool.definitions,

Run the Agent in the Agent Service playground.
